# Coffee & Chemistry Dating App

This is a dating app that was creating using MERN stack. You can match, un-match, reject, and message users. You can also update your public profile and delete conversations. Almost like Tinder!

Simply, sign up (email and password do not have strict requirements), and start "swiping". Once the person with whom you want to match accepts it, you can start messaging!

## FEATURES
* Ability to choose whether or not you want to match with other users.

* If a user wants to match with you, you can chooose whether to accept or reject it.

* Rejected users will not be seen amongst the other users. You Wouldn't want to see them again if you're not interested, right?

* Users who have matched with eachother are able to message eachother.

* Users can see everyone with whom they have matched in the Messages page, from where they can select which conversation to continue.

* No longer interested in someone? you can delete the conversation, and that'll be the end of it.

* Users can update their profile by editing their profile picture and bio.


### BIGGEST CHALLENGE
The biggest challenge was adding the logic for users to be able to upload their pictures to an S3 bucket so that everyone can see it. 


### KEY TAKEAWAY
No matter how hard it gets, don't give up on your ideas!
